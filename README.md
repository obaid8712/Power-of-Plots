# Power-of-Plots:

The ride sharing bonanza continues! Seeing the success of notable players like Uber and Lyft, CEO decided to do some Data analysis at this time. CEO and Chief Data analyst discussed this issue at length and Data analysis team will be expected to offer data-backed guidance on new opportunities for market differentiation.

Data analyst team got access to the company's complete recordset of rides. This contains information about every active driver and historic ride, including details like city, driver count, individual fares, and city type.

### The objective is to build a Bubble Plot that showcases the relationship between four key variables:

* Average Fare ($) Per City
* Total Number of Rides Per City
* Total Number of Drivers Per City
* City Type (Urban, Suburban, Rural)

After hard work team found following figure for CEO, Thanks to matplot and python.
